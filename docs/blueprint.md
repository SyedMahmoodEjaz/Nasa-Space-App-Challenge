# **App Name**: Embiggen Your Eyes

## Core Features:

- Data Ingestion: Ingest massive image datasets from NASA, including those from HiRISE and other missions. Supports various image formats and data types.
- Interactive Zoom & Pan: Enable seamless zooming and panning across gigapixel and terapixel images, allowing users to explore details without lag.
- Feature Labeling: Allow users to label known features within the images, contributing to a community-driven knowledge base.
- Pattern Discovery Tools: Provide tools for identifying and highlighting new patterns within the image datasets, such as change detection and anomaly detection.
- Multi-Layer Overlay: Give users the option to overlay related image sets (e.g., different colors of light, laser altimeter data) and explore them simultaneously.
- Search Functionality: Allow users to search through images using coordinates, names of features, or AI-powered text descriptions to find specific areas of interest using an AI tool.
- Time-Lapse Exploration: Enable interactive exploration of video imagery in both time and space, allowing users to see changes over time.
- Adaptive Image Scaling: Implement adaptive image serving to ensure optimal user experience without requiring the app to download all data at once.
- Data Stitching: Automatically stitch together individual partial images to produce a full, seamless image for exploration.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep space blue (#0B3D91) to convey the vastness of space.
- Secondary color: Star white (#FFFFFF) for contrast and readability.
- Accent color: Nebula purple (#6A4C93) to highlight interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Orbitron' (sans-serif) for a futuristic, space-themed feel.
- Body font: 'Roboto' (sans-serif) for clean and easy readability.
- Use minimalist, line-based icons to represent different features and tools.
- Maintain a clean and intuitive layout with clear sections for image display, search, and tools.
- Include an initial animation with the tagline 'space | science | innovation' before app launch.
- Use subtle animations for zooming, panning, and data loading to provide visual feedback.
